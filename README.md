# SternBrocotR

The **SternBrocotR** R package provides tools for approximating real numbers as rational fractions using the Stern-Brocot tree. This package is ideal for applications requiring precise fractional approximations with configurable uncertainty bounds. It includes metadata about the approximation process, such as the depth of the Stern-Brocot tree traversal and binary path representation.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of **SternBrocotR** from GitHub:

```r
# Install the 'remotes' package if you don't have it
install.packages("remotes")

# Install SternBrocotR from GitHub
remotes::install_github("homeymusic/SternBrocotR")
```

---

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get started:

### Approximate a Real Number to a Fraction
```r
library(SternBrocotR)

# Approximate 0.49 with symmetrical uncertainty
result <- stern_brocot(0.49, uncertainty = 0.03)
print(result)
# Output: A dataframe with the fraction 1/2 and additional metadata
```

### Approximate with Asymmetrical Uncertainty
```r
# Approximate 0.49 with different lower and upper uncertainty
result <- stern_brocot(0.49, uncertainty = c(0.04, 0.02))
print(result)
# Output: A dataframe with the fraction 1/2 and additional metadata
```

### Output Details
The result includes:
- `num`: Numerator of the fraction
- `den`: Denominator of the fraction
- `approximation`: The decimal approximation (`num / den`)
- `error`: Difference between the approximation and the input
- `valid_min` and `valid_max`: Bounds for the approximation
- `depth`: Depth of the Stern-Brocot tree traversal
- `path`: Binary representation of the tree path
- `path_id`: Binary path converted to an integer
