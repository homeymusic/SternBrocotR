\title{Approximate a real number as a fraction using the Stern-Brocot tree}
\usage{
stern_brocot(x, uncertainty)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A single numeric value to approximate as a fraction. Must be a finite value.}

\item{uncertainty}{Either:
- A single positive numeric value representing symmetrical uncertainty bounds (i.e., Â±uncertainty), or
- A vector of two positive numeric values, where the first element is the lower uncertainty and the second
  is the upper uncertainty, defining the range `[x - lower, x + upper]`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
  - `x`: The original value of `x`.
  - `num`: The numerator of the approximated fraction (an integer).
  - `den`: The denominator of the approximated fraction (a natural number > 0).
  - `approximation`: The value of the fraction `num / den`.
  - `error`: The difference between the approximation and the original value of `x`.
  - `valid_min`: The lower bound of the uncertainty range.
  - `valid_max`: The upper bound of the uncertainty range.
  - `depth`: The depth of the Stern-Brocot tree traversal (number of steps taken).
  - `path`: The path taken in the Stern-Brocot tree as a binary string.
  - `path_id`: The binary path represented as an integer.
}
\description{
This function approximates a real number as a rational fraction (numerator and denominator)
using the Stern-Brocot tree. It supports specifying a tolerance (uncertainty) to determine
how close the approximation should be to the real number.

\examples{
# Approximation with symmetrical uncertainty
stern_brocot(0.49, uncertainty = 0.03)  # Returns approximately 1/2

# Approximation with asymmetrical uncertainty
stern_brocot(0.49, uncertainty = c(0.04, 0.02))  # Returns approximately 1/2
