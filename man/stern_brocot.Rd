\title{Approximate a real number as a fraction using the Stern-Brocot tree}
\usage{
stern_brocot(x, uncertainty)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A single numeric value to approximate as a fraction. Must be a finite value.}

\item{uncertainty}{Either:
\itemize{
\item A single positive numeric value representing symmetrical uncertainty bounds (i.e., Â±uncertainty), or
\item A vector of two positive numeric values, where the first element is the lower uncertainty and the second
is the upper uncertainty, defining the range \verb{[x - lower, x + upper]}.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: The original value of \code{x}.
\item \code{num}: The numerator of the approximated fraction (an integer).
\item \code{den}: The denominator of the approximated fraction (a natural number > 0).
\item \code{approximation}: The value of the fraction \code{num / den}.
\item \code{error}: The difference between the approximation and the original value of \code{x}.
\item \code{valid_min}: The lower bound of the uncertainty range.
\item \code{valid_max}: The upper bound of the uncertainty range.
\item \code{depth}: The depth of the Stern-Brocot tree traversal (number of steps taken).
\item \code{path}: The path taken in the Stern-Brocot tree as a binary string.
\item \code{path_id}: The binary path represented as an integer.
}
}
\description{
This function approximates a real number as a rational fraction (numerator and denominator)
using the Stern-Brocot tree. It supports specifying a tolerance (uncertainty) to determine
how close the approximation should be to the real number.

\examples{
# Approximation with symmetrical uncertainty
stern_brocot(0.49, uncertainty = 0.03)  # Returns approximately 1/2

# Approximation with asymmetrical uncertainty
stern_brocot(0.49, uncertainty = c(0.04, 0.02))  # Returns approximately 1/2
